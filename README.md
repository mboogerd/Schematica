# Schematica

Schematica is an open-source (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) modification for [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/). The original project can be found *[here](https://github.com/Lunatrius/Schematica)*, which is where you should download it from if you are interested. 


# Reasons for this fork
This fork mainly serves as a reliable backup for my local source code, besides allowing Lunatrius to pull if he likes the development here.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I have several desires for this mod, which I aim to realize in this fork. The mod does a great job of importing/exporting schematics, but it relies on mechanics that don't feel 'minecrafty'. Minecraft is about operations on blocks and items, with few interactions between player characters and NPC's. Minecraft is also about community and this mod is single player only. It would be fun if more minecraft-typical mechanics could be used to render/manipulate/create schematics, as well as trading them with other members on the server. I will make no claims w.r.t. the likeliness of my success, but I intend to focus on those two issues in this fork.

## Building the jar file

To build a jar file, that can be installed alongside MinecraftForge, you'll have to create the file build.properties with the following properties (the default values may be changed to your liking):

```
dir.project=${basedir}
dir.workspace=${dir.project}/..
dir.mcp=${dir.workspace}/mcp
dir.release=${dir.project}/release
```
